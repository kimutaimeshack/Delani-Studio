# Delani-Studio
This is a practical project to implement everything I have learned from Bootstrap and jQuery to recreate a landing page for a fictional studio. I was provided with all the resources in the assets folder where I am to implement as it is given. The project is build using Javascript and jQuery for functionality, bootstrap and custom CSS for styling, and HTML for designing.
